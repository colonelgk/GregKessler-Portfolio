<p class=MsoNormal>Power Equipment online scheduling service. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Problem: Many people increasing cut their own grass either
for the joy or the economics. Owning power equipment does have multiple
downsides. Power equipment is subject to mechanical failures which can require
the need of a professional service technician and facilities for repair or
service. Units are often heavy and difficult to transport often requiring special
tools, trucks, lifts, or a trailer which most people do not possess. Repair
shops are very busy in season. Repairs and estimates often require appointments
for service due to high demand and limited apace and manpower.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Idea:  Create a website that allows customers several
options that would help them schedule their repair service. The website would
also allow the businesses to screen work , pair specialist technicians with
repairs , and efficiently process the repair queue.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Option 1: Schedule to have a technician come out and
evaluate the repair.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Option 2: Customer types in their unit along with services
they wish to have done. A rough estimate is then generated. Some repairs
require being picked up and delivered. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Option 3: Schedule a pickup. Could be outsourced to a third
party. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Option 4: Schedule an onsite repair. Usually involves
regular service. No Pickup required. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>All services would require a deposit. </p>
