	<h5>Project Proposal
Power Equipment online scheduling service. 
Problem: Many people increasing cut their own grass either for the joy or the economics. Owning power equipment does have multiple downsides. Power equipment is subject to mechanical failures which can require the need of a professional service technician and facilities for repair or service. Units are often heavy and difficult to transport often requiring special tools, trucks, lifts, or a trailer which most people do not possess. Repair shops are very busy in season. Repairs and estimates often require appointments for service due to high demand and limited apace and manpower.
Idea:  Create a website that allows customers several options that would help them schedule their repair service. The website would also allow the businesses to screen work , pair specialist technicians with repairs , and efficiently process the repair queue.
Option 1: Schedule to have a technician come out and evaluate the repair.
Option 2: Customer types in their unit along with services they wish to have done. A rough estimate is then generated. Some repairs require being picked up and delivered. 
Option 3: Schedule a pickup. Could be outsourced to a third party. 
Option 4: Schedule an onsite repair. Usually involves regular service. No Pickup required. 
All services would require a deposit. </h5>
